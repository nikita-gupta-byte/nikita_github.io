<p>Batman's secret identity is Bruce Wayne, a wealthy
American industrialist who resides just outside of Gotham City. As a child, Bruce
witnessed the murder of his parents, Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne, which
ultimately led him to craft the Batman persona and seek vengeance against
criminals. Wayne averts suspicion by acting the part of a superficial playboy idly
living off his family's fortune, which was amassed through investment in real
estate before the city became a bustling metropolis, and the profits of Wayne
Enterprises, his inherited conglomerate.Bruce Wayne resides just outside of
Gotham City in Wayne Manor. He supports philanthropic causes through his
nonprofit Wayne Foundation, but is more widely known as a celebrity socialite.
In public, he appears frequently in the company of high-status women, which
encourages tabloid gossip. Although Bruce Wayne leads an active romantic life,
crime-fighting accounts for most of his time</p>
